This is a small project to refresh the basic data structure and algorithm
The application will be divided by sub small module to cover different small subjects

All implementations for core data structure are very simple and easy to understand even for beginner

Optimization will be done overtime


Following subject will be cover

### Basic data structure and native implementation
- Array
- List
- Map
- Stack
- Queue

### Advanced data structure
- Ring buffer ( lock-free data structure)

### Concurrent Data structure and framework
- Non Blocking  
    - ConcurrentHashMap
    - NonBlockingQueue

- Blocking
    - BlockingQueue

### Basic Algorithms
- Strings
- Numbers
- Dynamic Program
- Recursive 

###  Algorithms
#### By topics
- Basic algorithms over core data structure
    - Insertion
    - Deletion
    - Searching
    - Sorting
        - Bubble sort
        - Insertion sort
        - Selection sort
        - Quick Sort
        - Rapid Sort
- Mics
